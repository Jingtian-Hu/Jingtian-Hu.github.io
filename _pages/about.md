Welcome to my website! I'm currently a master student at the [Department of International Relations](https://www.dir.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in the [School of Social Sciences](https://www.sss.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by  [Prof. Chong Chen](https://cc458.github.io/) at Tsinghua. Before graduate school, I received my Bachelor's Degree in International Politics from Tsinghua University with one of the highest honors. 

My substantive research interests include armed conflict & political violence, especially focusing on (1) the spatiotemporal dynamics and predictions of civil war; (2) the causes and consequences of armed conflict on major emergencies and social vulnerability.
